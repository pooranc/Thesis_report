\chapter*{Abstract}
Social media generates a massive amount of data every minute, Which has helped and created
many business opportunities. These data can be mined to find valuable patterns. Data regarding
the human mobility or migration flow can be used for many applications such as urban planning
or understanding disease spreading or even population prediction. But, data collection method
is outdated as data scientist use census data for identifying the patterns in inflow and outflow
of humans, lot of data and prediction is lost between census. Recent studies have shown that
this trends or patterns can be studied using tracking mobile phones signals, GPS, WIFI or even
with RFID devices. But, with these techniques there will be privacy concerns and data access
restriction.

Social media platform can be used to collect data. This paper proposes and explains the approach on how the Twitter data can be used to get useful information. In particular, the data mined on Twitter can be used to understand many aspects of Human Migration. In this paper, I will try to propose a technique on how to extract these Spatial-Temporal data to understand people migration. And with help of text from the tweet, detect the sentiment of the people who tweet regarding migration.
