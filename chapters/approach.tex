\section{Problem Formulation}

Social media generates a massive amount of data every minute, Which has helped and created 
many business opportunities. These data can be mined to find valuable patterns. Data regarding human mobility or migration flow can be used for many applications such as urban planning 
or understanding disease spreading or even population prediction. But, data collection method
 is outdated as data scientist use census data for identifying the patterns in inflow and outflow 
of humans, a lot of data and prediction is lost between census. Recent studies have shown that
this trends or patterns can be studied using tracking mobile phones signals, GPS, WIFI or even
with RFID devices. But, with these techniques, there will be privacy concerns and data access 
restriction.
